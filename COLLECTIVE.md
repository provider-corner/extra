# "extra" provider collective

The "extra" provider collective is the collection of people who claim
a stake in the "extra" provider, be it large or small.

If you contribute to this project and want attribution, this is the
place to add your name.

your name into your copy of this file.

Please note that having a name here doesn't imply any automatic
responsibility beyond what the license you submitted your file under
says explicitely.  It doesn't automatically make you a "supplier", a
community leader or anything of that sort.  Taking on such roles is a
separate decision and reponsibility to be taken by anyone who wants to.
